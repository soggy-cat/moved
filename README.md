the original **soggy.cat** project never went anywhere outside of the base frontpage in the past 2 years, <br>
and the only commits made after that were either by me <sub>(cv)</sub> or mat for [ssoggycat](https://twitter.com/ssoggycat?mx=1&elon=bald). <br>

because of this we've made the quick decision to transfer it to the main [ssoggycat organization](https://github.com/ssoggycat) for convenience <br>
don't worry, all of the members still have access to the original repo!! <sup>i think.. ⁱ ᵐⁱᵍʰᵗ ᵇᵉ ᵛᵉʳʸ ʷʳᵒⁿᵍ</sup> <br>

this organization will remain public for archival but don't expect any further updates here.. <br>
also, since you stumbled upon this page, please tell how! we've made a lot of redirects here over time and we might've forgotten to change some. <br>
